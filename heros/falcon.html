                    Samuel Thomas "Sam" Wilson, better known as Falcon, is a former United States Air Force pararescue airman, who left active duty when his wing-man Riley died in combat, instead choosing to help other veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. At this time, Wilson met Captain America and was drawn into his conflict with HYDRA, as Captain America needed help from anyone not associated with S.H.I.E.L.D. as they had been infiltrated by HYDRA. Retaking his title as the Falcon, Wilson had then assisted in destroying all Alexander Pierce's schemes of world domination. In ENDGAME Captain America gave his shield to him. He appaears in CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER(2014), CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR(2016), AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR(2018), AVENGERS: ENDGAME(2019).

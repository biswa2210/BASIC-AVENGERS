                            Jake Gyllenhaal plays the character of Quentin Beck, who was a former employee at Stark Industries who became embittered as Tony Stark disregarded his entire life's work, resulting in Beck losing his job. Seeking his retribution, Beck had joined forces with other former Stark employees to create a new superhero named Mysterio, using their Combat Drones and his own hologram technology to create an illusion of his own superpowers, as well as multiple attacks from the fictional Elementals. Knowing that he needed to create world threatening illusions to sell his lies, Mysterio had then gained the trust of Nick Fury in order to get closer to Spider-Man, as he knew that Stark had gifted Spider-Man with access to the technologies he needed. He appears in SPIDERMAN: FAR FROM HOME(2019).

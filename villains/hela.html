           Hela Odinsdottir was the Asgardian goddess of death and former executioner of            Asgard. Imprisoned in Hel for millennia by her father Odin, Hela was only            released from her prison in the wake of his death and went to restore her            power over Asgard, while simultaneously engaging in a series of encounters            with her younger brothers Thor and Loki. Gaining her power from Asgard, Hela planned to rule Asgard and create an Asgardian Empire.

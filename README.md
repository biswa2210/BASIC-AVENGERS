## About :point_down:

<div align="justified">
     
**:heart_eyes:Avengers' fans will love this!!!:heart_eyes:**
The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals, with either superpowers or other special characteristics. Its purpose was to protect global stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats. Though primarily affiliated with the United States of America, they worked with the peaceful interests of the whole world in mind rather than a specific country or organization. The Avengers were first assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. Under Captain America's leadership, the team completed several operations around the world with success. The story evolves till Thanos and his army had followed them, sparking the immense Battle of Earth, where Iron Man gave his life to defeat Thanos and his army. With the battle won and over, the Avengers disbanded. **This web application contains 52 web pages on avengers characters including heroes and villains. Marvel studious' animation is played at the beginning. Each pages contains different designs.**

The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a media franchise created by Marvel Studios, set primarily in a shared universe designated as the reality Earth-199999 within Marvel's multiverse system, with some installments also set in adjacents or branching realities. Starting with Iron Man, the franchise is comprised mainly of films independently made by Marvel Studios, that are primarily set within this same universe, much like Marvel has done with their comics. The franchise includes a series of short films, called Marvel One-Shots, launched with each film's Blu-ray release starting with Thor and finishing with Thor: The Dark World.

# Making :point_down:

<div align="justified">
     
I have used basic concepts of web development to make this web application. I have used HTML5, CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT only. I have used slider, card, polaroid, table, figure, row column concepts for designing. I have used animations for text, slideshow designing.

*I have used _[marvel fandom wiki]_ (https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) for references of every avengers' characters.*

*In the home page in marvel studious I have used this link for _[avengers' bio]_(https://www.marvel.com/characters).*

*I have used _[hotstar]_(https://www.hotstar.com/in) for movie links.*
